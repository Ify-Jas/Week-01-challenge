This is my bootcamp challenge-assignment for week 01.

## Description

This is a HTML/CSS code refactor challenge. We are supposed to look at the code and make it more optimisied for search engines. We were also given a set of guidelines for as acceptance criteria. Please find it below;

1. Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

2. Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code

3. HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

4. Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes

5. Heading attributes fall in sequential order

6. Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

I updated the title of the pade, I adjusted some HTML code to reduce the occurence of the <div> tag. I also updated the ID for the SEO page so that it will directly link from the navigation bar. For the heading, I capitalized the SEO in Horiseon to make it more visually attractive. I updated some classes on the index file to allow link one CSS file to all. I also used border-radius option in the stlyesheet just to beautify the section area.
